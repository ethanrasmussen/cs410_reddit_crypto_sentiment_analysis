Reddit Post Sentiment Analysis for Crypto-market Trend Prediction

**Scratch notes:**
We'll likely want these main components:
 - Reddit post grabber/processing functions
 - Sentiment analysis tools/funcs (via NLTK?)
 - Functions for grabbing real-time / real-market data (yfinance would be useful here)
 - Graphs/visualizations (plotly, matplotlib, etc.)
 - (Purely optional if we have time) Basic front-end to have up-to-date display & easy for graders/TAs to see
